# Calendar
 An improvement of a Codecademy project that creates a simple calendar from user's input.
 
 The project was started as a part of a freeform project on Codecademy. Improvements are made whenever I learn something new in Python.
 The calendar can perform 4 actions which are based on user's input. It offers:
 -Viewing the calendar
 -Adding an event
 -Updating an event
 -Deleting an event
